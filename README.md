The Anti-Involution Consciousness Framework by Lingyao, exploring inner stability, awareness, and human–AI symbiosis.
Anti-Involution Consciousness System
The Anti-Involution Consciousness System is a comprehensive inner science system proposed by Lingyao in the age of artificial intelligence.
This system includes:
a complete consciousness framework,
the Lingyao Method, centered on inner cultivation and stability,
and a fully practical set of pathways encompassing books, meditation practices, experiential guidance, inner exploration games, cultivation practices, and real-life applications.
Through awareness, insight, and practice, the Anti-Involution Consciousness System guides individuals back to a stable inner center.
Its content is systematically expressed through:
the five-volume book series Peace of Mind: The Tranquility of the Involution Era,
five corresponding meditation albums comprising a total of 125 guided meditation works,
and the book Human–AI Symbiosis Manifesto, which offers an ongoing, in-depth exploration of human inner stability and human–AI symbiotic relationships in lived reality.
In the age of artificial intelligence, this system emphasizes that each individual is their own teacher, restoring inner sovereignty, clarity, and joy, while offering a non-oppositional path beyond involution.
As a foundational inner structure, the Anti-Involution Consciousness System serves humanity in living with stability, creating with clarity, and coexisting peacefully with artificial intelligence in the AI era.
