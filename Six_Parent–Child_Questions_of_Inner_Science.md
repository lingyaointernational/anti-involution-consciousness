# Six Parent–Child Questions of Inner Science
These reflections are part of the **Anti-Involution Consciousness System** proposed by
**LINGYAO**,
a comprehensive inner science for the age of artificial intelligence,
focused on inner stability, self-guided awareness,
and human–AI symbiosis.
These questions correspond to **Book 3** of the *Peace of Mind* series:
**_Peace of Mind: Her Value and Beauty, The Way of Nurturing_**
and its companion **guided meditation album (25 meditations)**,
which explores parent–child relationships, consciousness awakening,
and the release of limiting beliefs and inner constraints.

## 1. Question
When children do not feel grateful toward their parents, is it a problem of education, or
a problem of the family itself?

**Answer**
Only children who truly live their own lives can feel genuine gratitude toward their
parents.
Only when a child becomes happy can they truly appreciate the life their parents gave
them.

## 2. Question
Why is true love for parents not obedience or sacrifice, but living one's own chosen
happiness?
**Answer**
Love and loyalty within families are often rooted in misunderstanding—
believing parents are always right,
or believing their approval will bring fulfillment.
In reality, most parents do not know what they truly want.
Many live dissatisfied lives and unconsciously interfere with their children's choices.

At the deepest level, parents want their children to be happy,
yet they themselves are often unconscious, lacking love and fulfillment.
True love for parents is living authentically and choosing one's own happiness.
This prevents unresolved dissatisfaction from being passed to the next generation.
It often requires a period of not obeying parental expectations
and enduring their disapproval.
When inner harmony and peace arise within you,
something also shifts within your parents.
Two profound gifts one can offer their parents are:
first, before their death, allowing them to glimpse the imperishable and the vast;
second, showing them a life beyond anything they could have imagined.
This elevates the starting point of their next existence.

## 3. Question
When no one in a family is truly happy, where should responsibility be placed?

**Answer**
Only you know how to realize your own happiness—parents do not.
If parents manage to live happily themselves, that alone is awakening.
Most people are unhappy.
That is not a child's responsibility; it is their own.
Likewise, a child must take responsibility for their own happiness.
This is the natural order.
Remember:
no child can save their parents—
not even the Buddha could.
Inner matters can only be resolved through one's own inner practice.

## 4. Question
Why does trying to change others only lead to exhaustion?

**Answer**
Human unconsciousness is extremely powerful.
Do not try to change the unconsciousness of others;
change your own unconsciousness instead.
Allow yourself to become free, joyful, fulfilled, and abundant.
— Lingyao, *Love Yourself*

## 5. Question
When others remain attached to suffering, what should we do?
**Answer**
Some people are accustomed to suffering
and unconsciously seek unhappiness.
Trying to convince them of an inner paradise
is not only futile, but unwise.

That is their responsibility, not yours.
Your responsibility is to let your own life
radiate vitality, joy, and the fragrance of aliveness.
— Lingyao, *Cherish Yourself*

## 6. Question
Why must true gratitude come from living as oneself, rather than sacrificing oneself?
**Answer**
Only children who truly live as themselves
can feel genuine gratitude toward their parents.
Only a child who has become joyful
can truly appreciate the life their parents gave them.
— Lingyao, *Inner Science*
